\section{Introduction}
Entanglement is a hallmark feature of quantum mechanics and allows for correlations between separated systems that go beyond those allowable through classical mechanics. Although the presence of entanglement itself does not represent any kind of advantage over classical computation or communication, when entanglement is present with operations restrictions, such as only allowing arbitrary \emph{local} operations and classical communication (LOCC) between subsystems, then entanglement can become a resource. In the simulation of quantum matter, such as the electronic structure problem in chemistry or finding ground states of condensed matter systems, highly entangled ground states can pose a barrier to classical computers. Despite this importance, our understanding of entanglement is mostly based on bipartite entanglement, or quantum correlations between two halves of a single quantum state. As many quantum systems tend to have more than two constituent parties recently efforts have been made to provide an analysis for multipartite entanglement \cite{horodecki2024multipartiteentanglement}. 

\textcolor{red}{\textbf{Multipartite entanglement paragraph here.}}

Multipartite entanglement on the other hand is very much less studied and there are much more nuanced quantities that can be defined.

In a seemingly unrelated area of research, mathematicians and computer scientists have developed analytical tools based on topology to provide insights into structural characteristics of datasets. These techniques, which fall under the umbrella term of Topological Data Analysis (TDA), gives an overview of how many ``holes" are present in a dataset across varying distance scales. The canonical example is if we have samples of coordinates from a 3-dimensional surface it would be nice to know if the samples come from a sphere compared to a torus. TDA generalizes spheres vs tori to higher dimensions and provides a robust analysis of the number of holes across distance scales to get an idea of what features are persistent in the dataset as opposed to transient noise. Further, TDA provides a single numerical summary of the underlying manifold that data is sampled from to give a topologically invariant quantity to the data, known as the Euler's Characteristic. In graphs this corresponds to the number of edges minus the number of vertices and in three dimensional shapes it is the number of edges minus the number of vertices and minus the number of faces. This gives a quick necessary heuristic to tell if two shapes or graphs are topologically equivalent but is not sufficient to declare they are indeed the same. 

Recently Hamilton and Leditzky \cite{hamilton2023probing} showed that TDA serves as a mathematically consistent framework for studying multipartite entanglement. They showed that various entropy functionals, such as the Tsallis $q$-deformed entropy, can be used to build simplicial complexes (higher dimensional analogs of graphs) that can be fed into the TDA pipeline. One of their main results is that the resulting Euler Characteristic is exactly equal to a previously used multipartite entanglement measure known as the $n$-tangle. This not only gives a more mathematically sound justification for the use of the $n$-tangle, which was later championed in \cite{horodecki2024multipartiteentanglement} and specifically the 3-tangle, but because the Euler Characteristic is a blunt summary there remains plenty of useful topological information in the TDA pipeline. 

In this paper we continue these efforts at providing mathematically rigorous interpretations to multipartite entanglement through TDA with the goal of providing operational interpretations to the topological information. For example, in bipartite entanglement theory the entropy of entanglement between two subsystems tells us the minimum fidelity of a teleportation protocol that can be carried out between the two, or the number of bell pairs that would be needed to prepare a given bipartite state. In Section \ref{sec:prelims} we give all the necessary mathematical background and notation needed for applying TDA to multipartite quantum states. As for concrete interpretations we give operational meaning for both the Euler Characteristic as well as a characterizing result for the more fine-grained barcode data. In Section \ref{sec:distillable_entanglement} we show that the Euler Characteristic provides an upper and lower bound on the average distillable entanglement between any random bipartition of a quantum state, which can be seen as the average quantum information that can be teleported between randomly chosen parties. In Section \ref{sec:graph_states} we then analyze the barcodes that result from graph states, a fundamental primitive used in quantum communication theory and measurement based quantum computing \cite{nielsen2006} under the name of cluster states. We show that the graph state of a star graph, which is unitarily equivalent to the GHZ state, has a distinct barcode pattern. We further show that \emph{any} quantum state with such a barcode must have come from such a graph state. This shows that the GHZ state has a distinct topological fingerprint, and could be used for future verification protocols. 
 
\section{Preliminaries}\label{sec:prelims}

\subsection{Entropic Measures}
\label{subsec:entropic_measures}

We study multipartite quantum systems over a Hilbert space $\hilb_A = \hilb_{1} \otimes \hilb_{2} \otimes \ldots \otimes \hilb_{n}$, where for simplicity we will assume each individual quantum system is a qubit $\hilb_{i} = \mathbb{C}^{2}$. We will work with pure states over the total Hilbert space $\hilb_A$ or $\hilb$, denoted $\rho_A = \ketbra{\psi}{\psi}$. The reduced density operator defined over a subset $J \subseteq A$ is equal to the partial trace $\rho_J = \partrace{J^C}{\rho_A}$, where $J^C = A \setminus J$. 

% If necessary, we let $Pos(\hilb_J) \coloneqq \set{X: \hilb_J \to \hilb_J | x^\dagger X x \geq 0 ~\forall x \in \hilb_J}$ denote the set of positive semidefinite operators on a Hilbert space $H_J$ and $D(\hilb_J) \coloneqq \set{\rho \in Pos(\hilb_J) | \trace{\rho} = 1}$ the respective density operators. 

We will primarily be concerned with entropic properties, both linear and logarithmic, of reduced density operators. The standard entropy used for quantum states is the von Neumann entropy $S(\sigma) = - \trace{\sigma \log \sigma}$, where the $\log$ denotes the matrix logarithm. This matrix logarithm is fairly unwieldy to use both in practice and analytically, so we will make heavy use of either the Tsallis entropy or the Renyi divergence instead. Both provide real-valued functionals for characterizing the mixedness or uncertainty in quantum systems. The Tsallis entropies are defined for a non-zero real number $q \neq 1$ and are given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tsallis_entropy}
    S_{q}(A)_{\rho} = \frac{1}{1 - q} (\trace{\rho_A^q} - 1).
\end{equation}

For $q=2$ the Tsallis entropy is equal to the purity of the state (defined as $1 - \trace{\rho^2}$) and in the limit as $q \to 1$ we have $\lim_{q \to 1} S_q(A)_{\rho} = S(\rho)$. We will omit the $\rho$ subscript from the expression when the quantum state is clear. Additionally, when referring to the entropy of a subset of the qubits in set $A$, we use $S_q(J)_{\rho} \equiv S_q(J)$ to denote the entropy of the qubits in the subset $J \subseteq A$.

We now introduce entanglement, focusing first on the bipartite case and mentioning a few key results in the multipartite scenario. Bipartite entanglement is a key feature of quantum mechanics and relies on a quantum state $\rho$ defined over a two party Hilbert space $\hilb = \hilb_A \otimes \hilb_B$. To define entangled states we first will describe what states are \emph{not} entangled, so-called separable states which are defined as all possible tensor products $\sigma\otimes \tau$, where $\sigma$ and $\tau$ are both valid density operators over $\hilb_A$ and $\hilb_B$ respectively. A state which is not a convex combination, or probabilistic mixture, of separable states is said to be entangled. The key notion is that a convex combination of separable states can be described as classical correlations between registers, which can be built via local unitaries performed separately on each space and classical communication between two operators of $\hilb_A$ and $\hilb_B$. A key quantity for bipartite entanglement is the entropy of entanglement, defined as $S(\rho_A) = S(\rho_B) = -\trace{\rho_B \log \rho_B}$, where $\rho_B = \partrace{\hilb_A}{\rho}$. The reason that this is a useful quantity to consider is that if $\rho$ is a pure state over the total Hilbert space $\hilb_A \otimes \hilb_B$, then the entropy of entanglement is zero if and only if the (pure!) state is separable.

After discussing what it means for quantum states to be entangled, a natural question arises: how can we quantify the correlation to distinguish quantum states with different levels of entanglement? These correlation measures are crucial for operational tasks such as communication, teleportation, and cryptography. By definition, they quantify entanglement in a quantum system, with more highly entangled states receiving higher values. These measures must satisfy several key properties, which are clearly outlined in \cite{guhne2009entanglement}. An important property to highlight is the invariance of the entanglement measure under local unitary operations. Entanglement can only be generated through global operations, as local operations only change the basis within individual quantum states without affecting the entanglement between subsystems. Therefore, LU(Local Unitary) equivalent quantum states have the same entanglement structure and correlation remains the same across all partitions. We will use this property in section \ref{sec:graph_states}. We will use these correlation measures to construct topological structures. However, we must be careful when selecting these measures, as they need to satisfy specific properties in order to form a valid topological structure. We will discuss this property further later in this section.

For bipartite quantum systems, the correlation measures are well-studied, and there are many entanglement measures used in the literature, such as entanglement of formation, negativity, and relative entropy. Entanglement in quantum states are defined across specific subsystems such that 

Since, in the bipartite scenario, we are measuring the correlation between only two subsystems, the singular value decomposition or the Schmidt rank of the quantum system effectively captures the entanglement between subsystems. However, in multipartite quantum systems, measuring correlations is difficult because the increasing number of subsystems give rise to more complex and inefficient mathematical systems defining them. In fact, the idea of maximum entanglement in such systems becomes obscure. Typically, to measure entanglement in multipartite quantum system, the generalized versions of bipartite measures are used.

A widely used bipartite measure is the mutual information or total correlation measure which was introduced in \cite{cerf1998information}. It is defined for a composite quantum $\rho_{AB}$ as 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:total_correlation_bipartite}
C(A, B) = S(A) + S(B) - S(AB)
\end{equation}

This quantity is interpreted in \cite{wintercorrelations} as the minimum amount of local noise required to transform the composite entanglement system $\rho_{AB}$ into a product state $\rho_A \otimes \rho_B$ by decorrelating them. This entanglement measure can be extended to the multipartite case using the notion of relative entropy. The quantum relative entropy for density operators $\rho$ and $\sigma$ is mathematically defined as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:relative_entropy}
D(\rho || \sigma) = \trace{\rho \log \rho} - \trace{\rho \log \sigma} = -S(\rho) - \trace{\rho \log \sigma} 
\end{equation}
if $\supp(\rho) \subseteq \supp(\sigma)$. Otherwise the relative entropy is defined to be $+ \infty$.

Quantum relative entropy is interpreted as the ``distance" measure between quantum states. As discussed in \cite{vderal1998relativeentropy}, \cite{vedral2002relativeentropy} , the mutual information measure can be represented in terms of relative entropy of quantum states. The mutual information for composite quantum state $\rho_{AB}$ is equal to the "distance" or distinguishably of $\rho_{AB}$ with its uncorrelated counterpart $\rho_A \otimes \rho_B$, 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:equality_of_RE_total_correlation}
    C(A, B) = D(\rho_{AB} || \rho_A \otimes \rho_B)
\end{equation}

We define a correlation measure for multipartite quantum states by extending the quantum relative entropy to systems involving multiple parties. Let quantum state $\rho_A$ be defined over Hilbert space $\hilb_A = \hilb_{1} \otimes \hilb_{2} \otimes \ldots \otimes \hilb_{n}$. The total correlation measure of $\rho_A$ is calculated as 
 \begin{equation}
 \label{eq:multipartite_total_correlation}
     C(A_1, A_2 \dots A_n) = D(\rho_{A} || \rho_{A_1} \otimes \rho_{A_2} \dots \rho_{A_n}) = S(A_1) + S(A_2) \dots S_(A_n) - S(A)
 \end{equation}

It is important to note that relative entropy is not a true distance metric, as it is neither symmetric nor does it satisfy the triangle inequality. These properties of relative entropy are discussed in more detail in \cite{vedral2002relativeentropy}. An important feature of the total correlation measure is that it satisfies the downward property for any quantum state with a set of qubits $ A = \{A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n\} $. Specifically, for any subset $ J \subseteq K \subseteq A $, we have:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:downward_closure_total_correlation}
    C(J) \leq C(K)
\end{equation}
This property is a consequence of the data processing inequality of relative entropy. The data processing inequality tells us that for any quantum channel $ \Phi : \mathcal{H}_X \to \mathcal{H}_Y $ and quantum states $ \rho $ and $ \sigma $, we have:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:data_processing_ineqaulity}
D(\Phi(\rho) || \Phi(\sigma)) \leq D(\rho || \sigma)
\end{equation}
where $ \Phi $ is a completely positive, trace-preserving linear map (see \cite{watrous2018theory}, \cite{dataprocessingnielsen} for more detailed definations). Since the partial trace can be considered a quantum channel, we can conclude that:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:data_processing_ineqaulity_partial_trace}
D(\Tr(\rho) || \Tr(\sigma)) \leq D(\rho || \sigma)
\end{equation}

 More intuitively, $D(\rho || \sigma)$ tells how well we can distinguish between the state $\rho$ and $\sigma$. On performing partial trace over a quantum state, we are losing information about the states. Since we have less information about both states the harder it becomes to distinguish the states than before. The downward closure property \ref{eq:data_processing_ineqaulity_partial_trace} holds for the relative entropy of any two quantum states. The total correlation measure is a special case of relative entropy, where the second state is the decorrelated counterpart of the first state. Therefore, the downward closure property also holds for total correlation as well. We can prove this property of total correlation without the complications of quantum channels by simply using the subadditivity property of entropy. The proof has been provided in \cite{hamilton2023probing}.


We use the $q-$ Tsallis total correlation measure in our Topological Data Analysis. We consider two versions of the total correlation measure by using different values of $q$ in Tsallis entropy, as described in equation \ref{eq:tsallis_entropy}. In Section \ref{sec:distillable_entanglement}, we focus on $1 - $ Tsallis entropy, and the correlation measure is defined in equation \ref{eq:multipartite_total_correlation}. The reason for choosing $q \to 1$ is to relate the topological features of the quantum state to the distillation rate of entanglement. The distillation rate corresponds more closely with the von Neumann entropy, or $1 -$ Tsallis entropy, compared to other values of $q$. In Section \ref{sec:graph_states}, we go with $ q = 2 $ for Tsallis entropy, which gives us the linear entropy of entanglement. So the correlation measure looks like this (similar to equation \ref{eq:multipartite_total_correlation}, but with the linear entropy):

\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:multipartite_2-deformed_total_correlation}
C_2(A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n) = S_2(A_1) + S_2(A_2) + \dots + S_2(A_n) - S_2(A)
\end{equation}

We choose $ q = 2 $ because it makes it easier to calculate the entropy of graph states, especially when using their stabilizer formalism.



\subsection{Topology Data Analysis and Notation}
\label{subsec:topology}

Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is a set of techniques for investigating properties of datasets related to their topology, or the underlying structure that the data points are drawn from. The purpose behind using topology is that the topology of a space is robust to continuous changes of the space, which when applied to data analysis means that the results drawn from TDA should be robust to significant sources of noise. TDA is of interest to the Quantum Computing community for two reasons. The predominant reason is the existence of fast quantum algorithms where no comparable classical algorithms are known. The regime for provable quantum advantages in TDA is an active area of research. The relatively recent application of TDA to quantum computing and information sciences is in revealing a link between computed topological quantities, namely the integrated Betti number, and entropic quantities of underlying quantum states on which TDA is performed. This connection between multipartite entanglement and topological data analysis is the area we explore here. 

% \rb{Need to mention the impact on topology on entanglmeny later after defining notion for topology}
To understand the impact of TDA on multipartite entanglement we first need to set our notation for the data we will be analyzing and the topological structures we will be using. Similar to techniques used in \cite{hamilton2023probing}, we consider individual qubits of multipartite quantum system as our vertices of the topological space. Let $ X^{(0)} = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_m\} $ be the set of distinct vertices, each representing a qubit in the input multipartite quantum state. We will primarily draw on techniques from simplicial homology, which establishes its geometric realization on simplicial complexes. A simplex is a geometric object represented uniquely by a subset of vertices from $ X^{(0)} $. More formally, an $ n-$simplex is defined as the set of $ n+1 $ distinct vertices from $ X^{(0)} $ that lie within an $ n $-dimensional space. Simplicial complexes consist of the vertex set $ X^{(0)} $ and various sets of $ n $-simplices, including  $ 1 $-simplices, up to $ (m-1) $-simplices. Additionally, simplicial complexes impose specific conditions: namely, that any subset of vertices and any non-empty intersection of simplices must also form valid simplices. Building on the concept of simplices, we define an $ n $-chain as a linear combination of $ n $-simplices. This can expressed as

$$
X^{(n-1)} = \left\{ \sum g_i \sigma_i \mid g_i \in G \right\},
$$
where $ G $ is an abelian group and $\sigma_i$ is an $n$-simplex. In this article, we take $ G $ to be the $ \mathbb{Z}_2 $ group.

Every $k$-chain complex $X^{(k)}$ takes on vector space structure with maps between them, $\partial_k : X^{(k)} \to X^{(k - 1)}$. The maps $ \partial_k $ are referred to as boundary operators, and their action on a $ k $-simplex is defined as
\begin{equation}
\partial([x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_k]) = \sum_i (-1)^i [x_0, \cdots, \hat{x_i}, \cdots, x_k],
\end{equation}
where the $ \hat{} $ operator denotes that $ x_i $ is dropped from the sequence $ [x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_k] $, see \cite{Hatcher:478079}. The action of boundary operators $\partial_k$ can be define more generally on $k$-chains using the linear property of the boundary operator $\partial_k(\sum g_i \sigma_i ) = \sum g_i \partial_k(\sigma_i )$.
This collection of vector spaces and maps is a chain complex, written as
\begin{equation}
    X^{(n)} \xrightarrow{\partial_n} X^{(n-1)} \xrightarrow{\partial_{n-1}} \ldots X^{(1)} \xrightarrow{\partial_1} X^{(0)} \xrightarrow{\partial_0} 0,
\end{equation}
if we also enforce the homology condition: $\partial_{k + 1} \circ \partial_{k} = 0$. This can be rewritten as requiring $\im \partial_{k + 1} \subset \ker \partial_{k}$. As $\im \partial_{k + 1}$ and $\ker \partial_{k}$ are subspaces of the vector space $X^{(k)}$, we can consider the quotient space $ H_{k} \coloneqq  \frac{\ker \partial_{k}}{\im \partial_{k + 1}}$, which is called the $k$\ts{th} homology group. Its dimension as a vector space is an important number, the $k$\ts{th} Betti number $\beta_k \coloneqq \dim(H_k) = \dim(\ker \partial_k) - \dim(\im \partial_{k + 1})$. The alternating sum of these Betti numbers gives the Euler Characteristic 
\begin{equation}
    \chi = \sum_{i = 0}^{k} (-1)^i \beta_i.
\end{equation}

To better understand the TDA pipeline, readers can refer to Figure \ref{fig:enter-label}. The analysis begins with a quantum state as input. The TDA process starts by calculating the entropy of the marginals of the input quantum state to construct simplices. For every subset of qubits in the input quantum state, we define correlation functions that map these sets of vertices to real numbers. In Section \ref{sec:distillable_entanglement}, we employ the total correlation measure as our functional, while for Section \ref{sec:graph_states}, we use the linear entropic correlation measure. Both of these functionals act as metric to quantify the degree of correlation in quantum states. We construct a simplex for a set of vertices $A$ if the correlation function $C(A)$ satisfies $C(A) \leq \epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is a filtration parameter. As we gradually increase $\epsilon$ from 0 to $\epsilon_{\text{max}}$, the set of vertices $A$ that satisfy the condition $C(A) \leq \epsilon$ forms a simplex at each step. These correlation measures possess the downward closure property, meaning that the correlation function is monotonic under partial traces, also discussed in \ref{subsec:entropic_measures}. Therefore, if a set of vertices $A$ satisfies $C(A) \leq \epsilon$, then any subset of $J \subseteq A$ will also satisfy the condition $C(J) \leq \epsilon$, ensuring that any subset of $A$ also forms a simplex. This property is crucial for the structure of simplices, as it guarantees that every non-empty proper subset of a simplex is also a valid simplex. We halt our analysis when the entire topological space forms a single simplex. The filtration parameter where we stop our computation is denoted $\epsilon_{max}$. Using these simplices, we can extract topological features such as Betti numbers and the Euler characteristic. While we have an intuitive understanding of these topological characteristics, developing a concrete method for interpreting them remains an open question. 

The Betti numbers and Euler characteristic are the main homological quantities we will use to get a quantitative estimate of the ``connectedness" of a simplicial complex $X$. The $0$-dimensional holes in the topological structure represent the number of connected components. If $X$ has a large $\beta_0$ this tells us there are a lot of disconnected pieces of the complex. A large $\beta_1$ tells us there are a lot of one-dimensional holes(corresponding to cycles) in the complex, similar to gluing a bunch of donuts together to tile a big square.  In contrast to traditional techniques in topological data analysis (TDA), persistent homology tracks the lifespan of holes—specifically, their birth and death times. The intuition behind this approach is that the persistence of a hole reflects the ``significance" of noise in the dataset. In other words, holes that persist longer correspond to more ``important" defects in the dataset and vice versa. Persistent homology provides richer insights into the dataset, particularly by revealing the lifespan of holes. Higher-dimensional Betti numbers are computationally expensive and challenging to analyze. In this paper, we aim to provide an application of lower-dimensional Betti numbers in understanding the global quantum state.


Another application application of topology is to capture the fundamental skeletal structure of shapes. To quantify these structures, we use topological invariants like the Euler characteristic, which remains constant under bending and stretching of the shape, preserving its essential form. We will be performing our analyses using persistent homology, explained rigorously in \cite{hamilton2023probing}. We extend the notion of Euler characteristic to the reduced integrated Euler characteristic (IEC), denoted by $\tilde{\mathfrak{X}}$, which is again formally defined in \cite{hamilton2023probing}. This quantity is sum the Euler characteristic up to $\epsilon_{max}$. In the same paper, the authors Hamilton and Leditzky demonstrated that the IEC of multipartite quantum states is equivalent to the interaction information of the quantum state. We build upon this work to present an operational interpretation of the IEC of the quantum system.

% Now we explain the simplicial complexes we will construct and the topological data analysis pipeline. 

% Traditionally, in TDA using victoria rips complex, we  points in $X^{0}$ we construct a line, or edge, between $(x_i, x_j) \in X^{(1)}$ if $d(x_i, x_j) \leq \epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is a length scale that filters out far apart nodes. 

% In our analysis, we use functionals that map sets of vertices to real numbers. For Section \ref{sec:distillable_entanglement}, we employ the total correlation measure as our functional, while for Section \ref{sec:graph_states}, we use the linear entropy. Both of these functionals measure the degree of correlation in quantum states. We construct a simplex for a set of vertices $A$ if the correlation function $C(A)$ satisfies $C(A) \leq \epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is a filtration parameter. As we gradually increase $\epsilon$ from 0 to $\epsilon_{\text{max}}$, the set of vertices $A$ that satisfy the condition $C(A) \leq \epsilon$ forms a simplex at each step. These correlation measures possess the downward closure property, meaning that the correlation function is monotonic under partial traces, also discussed in \ref{subsec:entropic_measures}. In other words, if a set of vertices $A$ satisfies $C(A) \leq \epsilon$, then any subset of $J \subseteq A$ will also satisfy the condition $C(J) \leq \epsilon$, ensuring that the set form a simplex. This property is crucial for the structure of simplices, as it guarantees that every non-empty proper subset of a simplex is also a valid simplex. 

% We construct topological simplices based on the entanglement of a subset of qubits. The $0$-dimensional holes in the topological structure represent the number of connected components. At a filtration parameter $\epsilon$, if two vertices are not connected, they contribute to the $0$-th Betti number. From our construction of simplices, we know that if two points are not connected, the correlation measure between them exceeds $\epsilon$. Thus, a high persistence of less $0$-dimensional holes indicates a strong correlation between pairs of vertices in the topological structure. In other words, the more disconnected the structure remains, the greater the entanglement between pairs of points.

% The starting point of the TDA pipeline is the data, represented as a collection of points $\mathcal{D} = \set{x_i : 1 \leq i \leq n, x_i \in \mathcal{X}}$, where the only structure we need on the space $\mathcal{X}$ is the ability to compute a distance between points $d(x, y)$. 

% Once we have this dataset we then can construct the simplicial complex $X(\epsilon)$ we will compute the homology of. There are two ways to construct this complex, the Vietoris-Rips method and the Cech method. For starters we will stick to the computationally simpler Vietoris-Rips method. The Vietoris-Rips complex $X$ has one node per point $x_i$ in $\mathcal{D}$. From these points we construct a line, or edge, between $(x_i, x_j) \in X^{(1)}$ if $d(x_i, x_j) \leq \epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is a length scale that filters out far apart nodes. Later we will show how changing $\epsilon$ gives TDA it's power, but for the purposes of illustrating the pipeline we will consider a fixed $\epsilon$ and typically drop the implicit parametrization $X(\epsilon) = X$. Once we have the edges of $X^{(1)}$ we fill in an element $(x_i, x_j, x_k)$ in the next dimension $X^{(2)}$ if and only if these nodes form a clique in $X^{(1)}$, meaning all edges $(x_i, x_j), (x_i, x_k),$ and $(x_j, x_k)$ are present in $X^{(1)}$. We then proceed to higher dimensions, filling in a simplex if there is a clique present in $X^{(1)}$. Clique finding is a notoriously difficult problem without an upper bound on the size of cliques to check, so we put a cap on the dimension $n$, or cliques of size $n + 1$ nodes.

% \subsection{Simplicial complexes} \label{sec:simplicial_defs}

% We will be working with simplicial complexes and homological constructions, so should give some simple definitions. Let $X^{(0)} = \set{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n}$ denote the set of vertices.  
% \begin{definition}[Simplicial Complex] \label{def:simplicial_complex}
%     A (abstract) simplicial complex defined over a set of points $X^{(0)}$ is a collection $X$ of subsets of $X^{(0)}$ such that if $\tau \in X$ and $\sigma \subseteq \tau$ then $\sigma \in X$. 
% \end{definition}

% \begin{definition}[n-simplex $\Delta ^ n$] \label{def:n-simplex}
%     A geometric figure determined by a collection of $n + 1$ points in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$. It is defined as a complete graph on $n+1$ vertices or a n-dimensional clique.
% \end{definition}

% Generally in Homology a n-simplex is formed when $n + 1$ points in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ forms a clique, ie when every n-1 simplex contained in the n simplex is formed. However, In this paper \cite{hamilton2023probing} A simplex is formed only when the filtration parameter $\epsilon$ is greater than the functional $F(\rho)$ ie $F(\rho) \leq \epsilon$. We can think of simplex formation as subsets of  $X^{(0)}$ being added to a collections. There are n collections: One collection to contain subsets of size ranging from $1$ to $n$. Sometimes we write n-simplex as $[x_0, .., x_n]$ where $x_i$ are the vertices belonging to the n-simplex

% \begin{definition}[Face of simplex] \label{def:n-simplex}
%     Given a n-simplex $[x_0, .., x_n]$, we have the simplex containing $n+1$ points. If we delete an arbitrary point from n-simplex then we are left with n points which form a $n$ points which form a $n-1$-simplex following the definition 2 of a simplicial complex. This $n-1$ simplex formed is called the face of the n-simplex
% \end{definition}

% In \cite{hamilton2023probing}, we are using a functional $F(\rho)$ on subset of vertices and filtration parameter $\epsilon$ such that subset of vertices form a simplex when $F(\rho) \leq \epsilon$. Since every face of a n-simplex is also a simplex we want every face of the n-simplex to form a simplex before the n-simplex is formed. This requires monotonicity from the functional F such that $F(I) \leq F(J) $ for $I \subseteq J$  

% \begin{definition}[n-chain] \label{def:n-chain}
%     Let $A_1^n, A_2^n, A_3^n, ... A_k^n$ be arbitrary oriented n-simplices of a complex K and an abelian group G, we define an n-chain x with coefficients in G as a formal sum:
%     $$x = g_1 \cdot A_1^n + g_2 \cdot A_2^ n + g_3 \cdot A_3^ n + ... g_k \cdot A_k^ n $$
%     where $g_i \in G$.
%     In most cases $G = Z$. However for our purposes and for the sake of simplicity, we assume $G = \{0, 1\}$ or $Z_2$. Let $L_n$ be the group of n-chains
% \end{definition}

% \begin{definition}[Boundary of n-simplex] \label{def:Boundary of n-simplex}
%     Let $A^n$ be an oriented n-simplex in a complex K. The boundary of $A^n$ is defined as the $n - 1$ chain of K over abelian group G given by 
%     $$\delta(A^n) = A_0^{n-1} + A_1^{n-1} + A_2^{n-1} ... + A_n^{n-1}$$
%     where $A_i^{n-1}$ is a n-1 face of n-simplex $A^n$. 
%     \\ The boundary of $A^n$ is given by n+1 number of $n - 1$ simplex.
% \end{definition}
% \begin{definition}[Boundary of n-chain] \label{def:Boundary of n-chain}
%     For any n-chain, $l = \Sigma_{i=1}^{i=k} g_i \cdot A_i^{n}$ we define the boundary of chain to to be 
%     \begin{equation}
%         \delta(l) =   \sum_{i=1}^{i=k} g_i \cdot \delta(A_i^{n})
%     \end{equation}
%     where $A_i^{n}$ are the n-simplexes of K. Therefore, the boundary operator $\delta$ is a homomorphism $\delta$ : $L_n \xrightarrow{} L_{n-1} $
% \end{definition}
% \begin{definition}[Cycle] \label{def:Cycle}
%     When an n-chain has boundary 0, the n-chain is considered a cycle. It is represented as the $Ker(\delta)$
% \end{definition}
% \begin{definition}[Homology Group $H_n$] \label{def:Homology Group}
%     We define the homology Group $H_n = Ker(\delta) / Im(\delta)$
% \end{definition}
% \begin{definition}[kth Betti Number] \label{def:kth Betti Number}
%     We define the kth Betti Number as the rank of the kth homology Group, ie $B_k = rank(H_k)$
% \end{definition}
% \begin{definition}[Euler Characteristic] \label{def:Euler Characteristic}
%     This has two definitions first based on the betti number and another based on the number of simplicial complex. 
%     \begin{equation}
%         \chi = \sum_i (-1)^i \cdot B_i
%     \end{equation}
%     Let $n_k$ be the number of k-simplices.

\section{Entanglement Distillation} \label{sec:distillable_entanglement}
Quantum gate (or state) teleportation is a foundational protocol in Quantum Computing and information sciences. In Quantum Computing, T-gates are teleported from so called ``magic state" factories to be used to implement T-gates within the operation of an error-correcting code. This is crucial to avoid the Easton-Knill Theorem, which states that the logical operations available to implement transversally (meaning the operation acts on the encoded quantum state) are \emph{not} fully universal and that the two routes to avoid this are to either switch from one quantum code to another, such that all gates can be done, or to create resource states outside of the quantum code and use gate teleportation to apply the gate. Utilizing gate teleportation is a much simpler route that most fault-tolerant research analyzes. Behind this crucial operation of teleportation lies a  primitive known as a Bell pair, which is a pair of entangled qubits in one of the following four states
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\ket{0}\ket{0} \pm \ket{1}\ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{\ket{0}\ket{1} \pm \ket{1}\ket{0}}{\sqrt{2}}. 
\end{equation}
In this section we explore how the number of such pairs that can be extracted, called the Distillable Entanglement, from bipartitions of a multipartite state is related to the Integrated Euler Characteristic (IEC) of an entanglement complex derived from the multipartite state.

Consider a global pure state $\rho = \ketbra{\psi}{\psi}$ over our Hilbert space $\mathcal{H} = (\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes n}$ and suppose that we split the state in half, giving a subset $A \subsetneq S$ of qubits to Alice and $B = S \setminus A$ to Bob. Denote their respective states $\rho_A = \Tr_B ( \ketbra{\psi}{\psi})$ and $\rho_B$ similarly. Now imagine the global state happens to be a product state across this bipartition, so $\rho = \rho_A \otimes \rho_B$. No matter what LOCC channels Alice or Bob apply, they will never be able to share a Bell pair between themselves. On the complete opposite end of the spectrum, if the global state is equal to a tensor product of Bell pairs $\rho = \left(\frac{\ket{0}\ket{0} + \ket{1}\ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^{\otimes n} \left(\frac{\bra{0}\bra{0} + \bra{1}\bra{1}}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^{\otimes n}$, then we can split up each of the pairs, giving one half to Alice and the other to Bob, and without doing any LOCC they will share $n$ Bell pairs. This number is called the distillable entanglement $E_D$ and it is defined as the upper limit to how many Bell pairs Alice and Bob can create using their part of the state $\rho$, along with LOCC channels. This is defined formally below. 

% \textbf{General Idea}: Does the Integrated Euler characteristic(IEC) tell us anything about the Entanglement distillation \\
% Consider an arbitrary pure state $\ket{\psi}$ lying in Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$. The corresponding density operator is $\rho = \ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}$.
% We partition the quantum system $\rho$ into two subsystems, A and B, such that their combined state resides in the Hilbert space  $\mathcal{H} = \mathcal{H_A} \otimes \mathcal{H_B}$. The reduced states $\rho_A = \Tr_B(\ket{\psi}\bra{\psi})$ and $\rho_B = \Tr_A(\ket{\psi}\bra{\psi})$ are then sent to Alice and Bob, respectively, each having access only to their state. They are allowed to perform any unitary transformations and measurements, on their respective subsystems and can coordinate their actions through rounds of classical communication (LOCC). Given multiple copies of their respective system, Alice and Bob convert their input to the maximum number of singlets possible.

% The composite quantum state $\rho$, partitioned into subsystems A and B, is represented as $\rho_{AB}$. Given Alice and Bob gets subsystem $\rho_A$ and $\rho_B$ respectively, the maximum number of singlets Alice and Bob can distill using LOCC is represented by $E_D(\rho_{AB})$. In a multi-party scenario, the original state can be partitioned and singlets distilled in several ways by sending observers Alice and Bob different partitions. We introduce the quantity called the average entanglement distillation rate, $\langle E_D \rangle$, which represents the average rate of entanglement distillation across all possible partitions of the multipartite input state. We show that the integrated Euler characteristic can be both upper and lower bounded by the quantity $\langle E_D \rangle$, thereby revealing a connection between Topological Data Analysis and the distillation rate.

\begin{definition} [Distillable Entanglement $E_D(\rho_{AB})$]
Let $\rho = \ketbra{\psi}{\psi}$ be a pure quantum state over a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ with a bipartition $\mathcal{H} = \mathcal{H}_A \otimes \mathcal{H}_B$. Let $\Phi_{A \times B}^{(n)} \in LOCC((\mathcal{H}_A \otimes \mathcal{H}_B)^{\otimes n})$ be a family of ``distilling" channels that utilize only LOCC operations between asymptotically many copies of $\mathcal{H}_A$ and $\mathcal{H}_B$ that aim to create copies of Bell pairs $\tau = \left(\frac{\ket{0}\ket{0} + \ket{1}\ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \left(\frac{\bra{0}\bra{0} + \bra{1}\bra{1}}{\sqrt{2}} \right)$. The \emph{distillable entanglement} is then the supremum value of all integers $m$ such that 
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} F\left( \tau^{\otimes m}, \Phi_{A \times B}^{(n)} (\rho^{\otimes n}) \right) = 1.
$$

% is defined the maximum rate at which singlet states can be distilled from an asymptotically large copies of the arbitrary input quantum state $\rho$ using a Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) protocol.
% \begin{equation} 
%     E_D(\rho) = \sup_{LOCC} \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{m}{n}
% \end{equation}
% The LOCC protocol maps n copies of input state $\rho$ to m copies of output singlet states
% \end{definition}
% \begin{definition} [Entanglement Cost $E_C(\rho)$)]
%     Entanglement Cost is defined as the minimum rate at which asymptotic copies of singlet states can be transformed to an arbitrary output state $\rho$ using a Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) protocol.  
% \begin{equation}
%     E_C(\rho) = \inf_{LOCC} \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{m}{n}
% \end{equation}
% The LOCC protocol maps n copies of input singlet state to m copies of output state $\rho$
\end{definition}
\begin{definition} [Average Distillable Entanglement]
    Let $\rho = \ketbra{\psi}{\psi}$ be a pure multipartite quantum on Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_A = \mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}_1} \otimes \mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}_2} \otimes \dots \otimes \mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}_n}$  where $\mathcal{A} := \{\mathcal{A}_1, \ldots \mathcal{A}_n\}$. The average distillable entanglement is the mean value of the distillable entanglement calculated over all possible bipartitions of $\mathcal{H_A} = \mathcal{H}_J \otimes \mathcal{H}_{J^c}$ where $J \subseteq A$ and $J^c = A \setminus J$
    \begin{equation}
     \langle E_D \rangle = \frac{\sum_{\substack{J \subseteq \mathcal{A}} }E_D(\rho_{J J^{C}})}{2^n}.
    \end{equation}
    
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}
\label{theroem:euler_characteristic_distillation}
Let $\rho = \ketbra{\psi}{\psi}$ be a pure multipartite quantum state on Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_A = \mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}_1} \otimes \mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}_2} \otimes \dots \otimes \mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}_n}$  where $\mathcal{A} := \{\mathcal{A}_1, \dots \mathcal{A}_n\}$. The reduced Integrated Euler characteristic $\tilde{\mathfrak{X}}(\infty)$ of the persistence module created using functional $C(J)_\rho = \sum_{v \in J} S(v)_\rho - S(J)_\rho$ for $J \subseteq A$ is bounded below and above by,
\begin{equation}
\langle E_D \rangle - \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_{\text{max}}  \leq \frac{\tilde{\mathfrak{X}}(\infty)}{2^n} \leq \langle E_D \rangle
\end{equation}
where $\langle E_D \rangle$ is the average distillable entanglement of $\rho$ and $\epsilon_{max}$ is that maximum filtration parameter where the barcodes of persistence module stops changes.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
For pure states $\rho_{AB}$, Ref.\cite{bennet_distillation} showed that the entanglement distillation rate, when partitioning the state $\rho$ into subsystems $A$ and $B$, can be quantified by the entropy of entanglement, given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Distillation_Cost_Equality}
     E_D(\rho_{AB}) = S(\rho_A) = -\Tr(\rho_A \log \rho_A)
\end{equation}
where $\rho_A = \Tr_B(\ket{\psi}\bra{\psi})$. For reduced density state $\rho_A$, the von Neumann entropy is denoted as $S(A)_\rho \equiv S(\rho_A)$.

Let $\rho$ be a pure quantum state over Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}} $. The Hilbert space $ \mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}} $ is defined as $ \mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}_1} \otimes \mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}_2} \otimes \dots \otimes \mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}_n} = (\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes n} $ where $\mathcal{A} := \{\mathcal{A}_1, .... \mathcal{A}_n\}$. According to Theorem 4.18 in  \cite{hamilton2023probing}, the integrated Euler characteristic is given as a sum over subsets of the total Hilbert space as
% \setlength{\jot}{5pt}
\begin{flalign}
    \tilde{\mathfrak{X}}_q(\infty) &=  \sum_{J \subseteq  \mathcal{A}} (-1)^{|J| - 1} S_q(J)_{\rho}.
\end{flalign}
As $q \rightarrow 1$, Tsallis entropy defined as $S_q(J)_{\rho}$ approaches the von Neumann entropy, $\lim_{q \rightarrow 1} S_q(J)_{\rho} = S(J)_{\rho} = -\Tr(\rho_J \log \rho_J)$. Using von Neumann entropy formalism in previous equation, 
\begin{flalign}
   \tilde{\mathfrak{X}}(\infty) &=  \sum_{J \subseteq  \mathcal{A}} (-1)^{|J| - 1} S(J)_{\rho}  \\
    \label{eq:IEC_rearranged}
    \tilde{\mathfrak{X}}(\infty) &=  \sum_{\substack{J \subseteq \mathcal{A}}}  S(J)_{\rho} - 2 \sum_{\substack{J \subseteq \mathcal{A} \\ |J| \text{mod} 2 = 0}}  S(J)_{\rho} 
\end{flalign}
Dividing equation $\eqref{eq:IEC_rearranged}$ by $2^n$, we get
\begin{flalign}
    \frac{\tilde{\mathfrak{X}}(\infty)}{2^n} &= \frac{\sum_{\substack{J \subseteq \mathcal{A}}}  S(J)_{\rho}}{2^n} - \frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\sum_{\substack{J \subseteq \mathcal{A} \\ |J| \text{mod} 2 = 0}}  S(J)_{\rho} 
\end{flalign}
Substituting in equation \eqref{eq:Distillation_Cost_Equality} in our previous equation, we get
\begin{flalign}
    \frac{\tilde{\mathfrak{X}}(\infty)}{2^n} &= \frac{\sum_{\substack{J \subseteq \mathcal{A}} }E_D(\rho_{J J^{C}})}{2^n} - \frac{1}{2^{n-1}} \sum_{\substack{J \subseteq \mathcal{A} \\ |J| \text{mod} 2 = 0}}  S(J)_{\rho}  
\end{flalign}
where $J^{C} = \mathcal{A} \setminus J$
\begin{flalign}
    \label{eq:IEC_avgDistillation_equality}
    \frac{\tilde{\mathfrak{X}}(\infty)}{2^n} &= \langle E_D \rangle - \frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\sum_{\substack{J \subseteq \mathcal{A} \\ |J| \text{mod} 2 = 0}}  S(J)_{\rho}   \\
     \frac{\tilde{\mathfrak{X}}(\infty)}{2^n} & \leq \langle E_D \rangle
\end{flalign}
as von Neuman Entropy is non-negative, ie $S(J)_\rho \geq 0$ for any $J \subseteq \mathcal{A}$.

The total correlation function for a multipartite quantum state $ \rho $ defined on the set $\mathcal{A} := \{ A_1, .... A_n \}$ is defined as 
\begin{equation}
    C(\mathcal{A})_{\rho} = \sum_{v \in \mathcal{A}} S(v)_{\rho} - S(\mathcal{A})_{\rho} 
\end{equation}
On rewriting the equation, entropy of the system on set $\mathcal{A}$ can be written in terms of the entropy of individual subsystems and correlation function
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:entropy_in_terms_of_correlation}
    S(\mathcal{A})_{\rho} = \sum_{v \in \mathcal{A}} S(v)_{\rho} -  C(\mathcal{A})_{\rho}
\end{equation}
Substituting in eq \eqref{eq:entropy_in_terms_of_correlation} into eq \eqref{eq:IEC_avgDistillation_equality} yields the following result
\begin{flalign}
    \frac{\tilde{\mathfrak{X}}(\infty)}{2^n} &= \langle E_D \rangle - \frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\sum_{\substack{J \subseteq \mathcal{A} \\ |J|\!\!\!\! \mod 2 = 0}} \left( \sum_{v \in J} S(v)_{\rho} -  C(J)_{\rho} \right) 
\end{flalign}
For an element $v \in A$, the number of even-length subsets that include $v$ can be determined by considering the remaining $n - 1$ elements. Odd-length subsets of the remaining $n-1$ elements are obtained by including v as an element in the set. The number of odd-length subsets of a set with $n-1$ elements is given by: $\sum_{k \mod 2 = 1} \binom{n - 1}{k} = 2^{n-2}$.
\begin{flalign}
    \frac{\tilde{\mathfrak{X}}(\infty)}{2^n} &= \langle E_D \rangle - 2^{n-2} \cdot \frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\sum_{v \in \mathcal{A}}  S(v)_{\rho} + \frac{1}{2^{n-1}} \sum_{\substack{J \subseteq \mathcal{A} \\ |J| \!\!\!\!\mod 2 = 0}}  C(J)_{\rho} \nonumber\\
    &=\langle E_D \rangle - \frac{1}{2}\sum_{v \in \mathcal{A}}  S(v)_{\rho} + \frac{1}{2^{n-1}} \sum_{\substack{J \subseteq \mathcal{A} \\ |J| \!\!\!\!\mod 2 = 0}}  C(J)_{\rho}
\end{flalign}
The correlation function is non-negative, a result that follows from the property of subadditivity. By omitting the correlation function from the previous equation, we obtain
\begin{flalign}
    \frac{\tilde{\mathfrak{X}}(\infty)}{2^n} & \geq \langle E_D \rangle - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{v \in \mathcal{A}}  S(v)_{\rho} 
\end{flalign}
Based on the definition provided in \cite{hamilton2023probing},  $\epsilon_{max}$ as the largest value of the filtration parameter at which the number of barcodes changes. For any quantum state $ \rho $ defined on the set $ \mathcal{A} $, $ \epsilon_{\text{max}} = \sum_{v \in \mathcal{A}} S(v)_{\rho} $. At this value of $ \epsilon_{\text{max}} $, the entire topological structure forms a simplex, resulting in the collapse of the barcode into a single 0-dimensional hole. The lower bound can be defined in terms of average entanglement distillation and $\epsilon_{\text{max}}$,
\begin{flalign}
    \frac{\tilde{\mathfrak{X}}(\infty)}{2^n} & \geq \langle E_D \rangle - \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_{\text{max}} 
\end{flalign}
\end{proof}
Theorem \ref{theroem:euler_characteristic_distillation} provides an insightful operational interpretation of the topological features of a quantum state. By bounding the IEC with the average distillation rate across possible partitions, we have a potential method for quantifying and predicting the efficiency of quantum state purification. A more mathematical interpretation of the theorem is that when calculating the distillation rate of a multipartite quantum state over statistically distributed partitions, the average distillation rate will be bounded by the Integrated Euler's Characteristic (IEC) of the quantum state. The IEC encapsulates the broader, global characteristics of the quantum state, and this result emphasizes how these global features influence local purification operations. The primary objective behind this result was to investigate more practical applications of topology within quantum information theory.

\subsection{$k-$uniform states}
We will now discuss the applications of the average distillable entanglement introduced earlier. A similar entanglement measure has been studied in previous works, such as in \cite{Scott_k-uniform} and \cite{meyer2001global}. In \cite{Scott_k-uniform}, the authors used the linear entropy measure instead of the von Neumann entropy that we have employed. Both entropic measures—those discussed here and in previous works—share the same core principle: they calculate the average entropy across all partitions of a multipartite quantum system. These measures have been used to identify a particular class of quantum states known as $k$-uniform states. This special class of quantum states has been studied under various labels, such as $k$-MM states \cite{Cerf_k-MM}, $k$-uniform states, and normal forms \cite{MoorNormal_form}. These states are useful in studying quantum error correction codes\cite{Scott_k-uniform}, characterizing entanglement \cite{meyer2001global}, and analyzing the effects of local unitary operations in quantum systems \cite{Kraus_LU_Equivalence}. In fact the construction of such quantum states have been an open problem for study in information theory \cite{Karol_k-uniform_construction}. A specific type of $k$-uniform system, known as the Absolutely Maximally Mixed State (AME), is a $\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$-uniform state. Because of its highly entangled structure, this class of quantum state has proven to be highly important in ADS/CFT protocols, holographic codes \cite{preskill_holographic_codes}, secret sharing \cite{Helwig_AME}, and teleportation protocols \cite{Helwig:2013ckb}. We will now define $k$-uniform quantum systems and discuss how they relate to our entanglement measure of average distillable entanglement.

\begin{definition}
\label{def:k-uniform}
($k$-uniform state)
    Let $\rho = \ketbra{\psi}{\psi}$ be a pure multipartite quantum state on Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_A = \mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}_1} \otimes \mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}_2} \otimes \dots \otimes \mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}_n} = (\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes n}$  where $\mathcal{A} := \{\mathcal{A}_1, \ldots \mathcal{A}_n\}$. We say that the quantum state $\rho$ if $k-$uniform if 
    \begin{equation}
        \rho_J = \rho_{J^c} = \Tr_{J^c}(\ketbra{\psi}{\psi}) = \frac{\identity}{2^k}
    \end{equation}
for each non empty subset $ J \subset \mathcal{A} $ with $ |J| = k $, and where $ J^c \coloneqq \mathcal{A} \setminus J $, the possible values of $ k $ range from $ 1 $ to $ \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor $.
\end{definition} 

\begin{definition}
    (Absolutely maximally entangled states)
    \label{def:AME_state}
    This is a special case of $k - $ uniform quantum state in which case $k = \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$. We say a quantum state is Absolutely maximally mixed if if maximally mixed across all bipartitions. More mathematically,   Let $\rho = \ketbra{\psi}{\psi}$ be a pure multipartite quantum state on Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_A = \mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}_1} \otimes \mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}_2} \otimes \dots \otimes \mathcal{H}_{\mathcal{A}_n} = (\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes n}$  where $\mathcal{A} := \{\mathcal{A}_1, \ldots \mathcal{A}_n\}$. We say that the quantum state $\rho$ is Absolutely maximally mixed state if 
        \begin{equation}
        \rho_J = \rho_{J^c} = \Tr_{J^c}(\ketbra{\psi}{\psi}) = \frac{\identity}{2^{min({|J|, n - |J|})}}
    \end{equation}
    for every non-empty subset $ J \subset \mathcal{A}, J^c = \mathcal{A} \setminus J$
\end{definition}

Note that we are considering subsystems with dimension 2. This definition can be easily extended to the general qudit case by replacing the exponent base with $D$, where the qudit is defined over a $D$-dimensional Hilbert space. Specifically, the $k$-uniform qudit states are defined as pure quantum states that satisfy the following condition
    \begin{equation}
        \rho_J = \Tr_{J^c}(\ketbra{\psi}{\psi}) = \frac{\identity}{D^{k}}
    \end{equation}
For this paper we only consider qubits as it makes the calculations easier. These notions would be applicable for quantum states of arbitrary dimension.


\begin{prop}
Let $\ket{\psi}$ be a product state, i.e., $\ket{\psi} = \bigotimes_{i=1}^{n} \ket{\psi_i}$. We propose that $\ket{\psi}$ is a product state if and only if the average entanglement distillation of $\rho = \ketbra{\psi}{\psi}$ is zero.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
The proof is straightforward, as a product state implies no correlations between any subsystems. The distillation rate for any partition is zero if and only if there are no correlations between the subsystems in that partition. Thus, the average distillable entanglement rate of $\rho$ is zero if and only if the state is a product state.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:ADE_iff_AME}
Let $\ket{\psi}$ be an $n$-qubit AME state (see Ref. \ref{def:AME_state}). We propose that $\ket{\psi}$ is an AME state defined over Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_A$ where $\mathcal{A} := \{\mathcal{A}_1, \ldots \mathcal{A}_n\}$ and $\mathcal{H_{\mathcal{A_i}}} = \mathbb{C}^2$  if and only if the average entanglement distillation of $\rho = \ketbra{\psi}{\psi}$ is given by:

 For odd $n$, 

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2^{n-1}} \sum_{i=1}^{\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor} \binom{n}{i} \log i,
\end{equation}


For even $n$, 

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2^n} \left( 2 \sum_{i=1}^{\frac{n}{2} - 1} \binom{n}{i}\log i + \binom{n}{\frac{n}{2}}  \log  \frac{n}{2}  \right).
\end{equation}

\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    Assume $\ket{\psi}$ is $\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$-uniform state. This implies that $\ket{\psi}$ is $k-$ uniform for all 
    $k < \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$. Thus, we have that $S(J) = \log k$ for all $J \subseteq A$ where $|J| = k < \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$. Since the state is AME (absolutely maximally entangled), the reduced density matrix becomes proportional to the identity matrix, leading to the maximum entropy for the local degrees of freedom. The average disttiable rate of the state follows the equation 
    
\begin{equation}
\langle E_D \rangle = \frac{\sum_{J \subseteq \mathcal{A}} S(J)_{\rho}}{2^n} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{\substack{J \subset A \\ |J| = i}} S(J)}{2^n}
\end{equation}

Note we only need to concern ourselves with proper subsets as the entropy of the entire quantum state is 0 as we assume the state to be pure. All the calculations follows strictly with the assumption that the state is pure. 
We now use the fact that $S(J) = S(J^c)$ for all $J \subset A$. This is easy to see when considering the Schmidt decomposition of the pure quantum state across the partitions $J$ and $J^c$. The reduced density matrix (RDM) of $\rho$ over subsystem $J$ shares eigenvalues with the RDM of $\rho$ over subsystem $J^c$. Therefore, for any $k < \lfloor\frac{n}{2} \rfloor$, we have that $\sum_{\substack{J \subset A \\ |J| = k}} S(J) = \sum_{\substack{J \subset A \\ |J| = n-k}} S(J) $. Using this property, the value of maximal entropy(discussed above) and some combinatorial properties, we can collapse the equation as 
\begin{equation}
\langle E_D \rangle =  \frac{ 2\sum_{i=1}^{\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor} \sum_{\substack{J \subset A \\ |J| = i}} S(J)}{2^n} = \frac{1}{2^{n-1}} \sum_{i=1}^{\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor} \binom{n}{i} \log i
\end{equation}
for odd qubits

\begin{equation}
\langle E_D \rangle = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{\frac{n}{2}-1} \sum_{\substack{J \subset A \\ |J| = i}} S(J) + \sum_{\substack{J \subset A \\ |J| = \frac{n}{2}}} S(J)}{2^n} = \frac{1}{2^n} \left( 2 \sum_{i=1}^{\frac{n}{2} - 1} \binom{n}{i} \log i + \binom{n}{\frac{n}{2}}  \log  \frac{n}{2}  \right)
\end{equation}
 for even qubits

The reverse direction of the proof follows because these values correspond to the maximum possible average distillable entanglement. The value is maximized only when we have a maximally mixed state across the reduced density matrices. This property is satisfied exclusively by AME states, by definition.
 A similar proposition was proposed in \cite{Scott_k-uniform}, where the entropic measure was maximised only if the state was a $k-$uniform state.
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}
\label{corollary:lower_bound_of_k-uniform}
    Let $\ket{\psi}$ be an $n$-qubit $k$-uniform state for some $k < \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$(see Ref. \ref{def:k-uniform}). The average distillable entanglement must be atleast $\frac{1}{2^{n-1}} \sum_{i=1}^{k} \binom{n}{i} \log i$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
Given that $\ket{\psi}$ is a $k$-uniform state for some $k < \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$, it follows that $\ket{\psi}$ is also an $m$-uniform state for all $m < k$. Using the same calculations from $\ref{prop:ADE_iff_AME}$, we can conclude our proposition. In that case, we did not need to consider whether $n$ is even or odd, as we were working with the $k$-uniform case where $k$ is strictly less than $\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$. Therefore, in the calculations, we did not encounter the scenario where a subsystem has the same size as its complementary system which lead to the extra term in the even case. Taking the contrapositive of the implication, we can also conclude that if the average distillable entanglement of the state is strictly lesser than $\frac{1}{2^{n-1}} \sum_{i=1}^{k} \binom{n}{i} \log i$, then the state is not $k-$uniform.
\end{proof}

After discussing the connections between $k$-uniform states and average distillable entanglement, we further talk about the utility of the Integrated Euler Characteristic (IEC) in detecting $k$-uniform states. Using \ref{theroem:euler_characteristic_distillation}, we can establish an upper bound on the average distillable entanglement:

\begin{equation}    
\langle E_D \rangle \leq \frac{\tilde{\mathfrak{X}}(\infty)}{2^n} + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{v \in \mathcal{A}}  S(v)_{\rho}.
\end{equation}


Computing the IEC provides us with a means of estimating this upper bound. Let's consider a few instances where the IEC of quantum systems is known. A large subset of pure quantum systems (particularly pure quantum systems with an odd number of qubits) have an IEC of zero. This is due to the same reasoning discussed in \ref{prop:ADE_iff_AME} regarding the Schmidt decomposition of pure quantum states. As a result, for all pure quantum states with an odd number of qubits, we have the inequality:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ADE_leq_correlation}
\langle E_D \rangle \leq \frac{1}{2} \sum_{v \in \mathcal{A}}  S(v)_{\rho}.
\end{equation}

This inequality can be particularly useful for efficiently narrowing down the potential $k$-uniform states that the input quantum system may belong to. Let $k'$ be that largest integer such that 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2^{n-1}} \sum_{i=1}^{k'} \binom{n}{i} \log i \leq \frac{1}{2} \sum_{v \in \mathcal{A}}  S(v)_{\rho} = \frac{1}{2}C(A)    
\end{equation}


for quantum state $\rho$ defined over Hilbert space $\mathcal{H_A}$. Using \ref{corollary:lower_bound_of_k-uniform}, we can conclude that $\rho$ is not $k'+1, \ldots \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$ uniform state. It turns out that a necessary condition for an odd qubit AME state is \ref{eq:ADE_leq_correlation}. 

Note that the IEC of the 

\subsection{Error Correction Code}
We continue discussing the applications of average distillable entanglement. We turn our attention towards error correcting codes, which play an integral role in making quantum computing feasible. These error correcting codes protect quantum states from external noise and decoherence, which might affect the reliability of the computation and information processing. These codes protect quantum states from external noise and decoherence, which can undermine the reliability of computation and information processing. By encoding the input quantum state, error-correcting codes ensure that the quantum state can be reliably decoded, even after being subjected to noise. We map an input state containing $k$ qubits, also known as physical qubits, into a higher-dimensional code space of $n$ qubits, referred to as logical qubits. A quantum code is said to correct up to $t$ errors if, after $t$ physical qubits are altered by noise, the original quantum state of $k$ qubits can still be faithfully recovered. The distance of a code space is defined as the minimum Hamming distance between any two codewords in the code space. An error-correcting code with a distance of $2t + 1$ can correct up to $t$ qubits affected by noise.

Let $\mathcal{Q}$ represent an error-correcting code space spanned by the logical basis $\{\ket{i_L} \mid i = 0, 1, \ldots, K-1\}$. The code space is a $K$-dimensional subspace of an $n$-dimensional vector space. Let $\mathcal{E}$ denote the set of errors detectable by the error-correcting code $\mathcal{Q}$. We say that a linear operator $E$, which introduces noise to our input state, is detectable by the code $\mathcal{Q}$ if and only if 

\begin{equation}
\bra{i_L}E\ket{j_L} = C(E) \delta_{ij},
\end{equation}


where $\ket{i_L}$ and $\ket{j_L}$ are logical basis vectors of the code space $\mathcal{Q}$, and $C(E)$ is a constant that depends on the operator $E$. This condition is a general property of error-correcting codes, as discussed in \cite{Nielsen_Chuang_2010}. 

The concept of distance in error correction comes into play when we discuss local error operators, which are defined as

\begin{equation}
E = M_1 \otimes M_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes M_n,
\end{equation}


where $M_i$ are linear operators acting on individual qubits in the vector space $\mathbb{C}^2$. The weight of a local error operator is defined as the number of $M_i$'s that are not scalar multiples of the identity operator. We say a code has distance at least $t$ if and only if all local error operators with weight less than $t$ are detectable by the error-correcting code $\mathcal{Q}$. Such codes are referred to as $(n, K, t)$ codes. These codes are considered pure if 

\begin{equation}
\bra{i_L}E\ket{i_L} = \frac{1}{2^n} \text{Tr}(E)
\end{equation}

for all $E \in \mathcal{E}$ and $\ket{i_L}$ belonging to the codes logical basis.
This is a high-level formalism of the error-correcting code $\mathcal{Q}$. A more detailed and concrete definition can be found in \cite{Scott_k-uniform}, where the authors also discuss the specific error basis being used and address several gaps not covered in the discussion above. Since we will not be explicitly using those identities they have been not discussed in this article.

An interesting result, proven in \cite{Scott_k-uniform}, shows that a pure quantum state $\ket{\psi}$ is $k$-uniform if and only if $\ket{\psi}$ corresponds to a $(n, 1, k+1)$ error-correcting code, as discussed above. The entanglement measure introduced in this article, the average distillable entanglement, achieves its maximum value (as stated in \ref{prop:ADE_iff_AME}) if and only if the quantum state is $\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$-dimensional. Therefore, the average distillable entanglement takes its maximum value if and only if the quantum state belongs to the QEC $(n, 1, \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor+1)$.

We have demonstrated that the average distillable entanglement measure is useful for detecting highly entangled states (AME) and error-correcting codes. In doing so, we've shown its relevance for both quantifying entanglement and identifying error-correcting codes.

\section{Graph States} \label{sec:graph_states}

To continue our application of TDA to multipartite entanglement, we turn to a previously developed class of states known as graph states. These states are represented using a graph $G = (V, E)$ and are a generalization of cluster states, making them fundamental primitives for Measurement Based Quantum Computing \cite{nielsen2006}. These states can exhibit highly complex, non-local entanglement, which, along with their relatively simple mathematic description, makes them ideal candidates for studying multipartite entanglement. 

Graph states can be defined in two equivalent ways, one via quantum circuits and the other using the stabilizer formalism. We will first give the circuit description. Given a graph $G$, which for the remainder of this section we assume to have only one connected component and at least 4 vertices, assign a qubit to each vertex $v \in V$. We will interchangeably refer to a vertex as it's qubit and vice-versa. Place a Hadamard gate on each vertex and for each edge $(u, v) \in E$ we place a controlled-Z gate between $u$ and $v$. The resulting quantum state is the definition of the graph state
\begin{equation}
    \ket{G} \coloneqq \prod_{(u, v) \in E} CZ(u, v) H^{\otimes V} \ket{0}^{\otimes V}. \label{def:graph_state}
\end{equation}
The controlled-Z rotation can be replaced with other 2-qubit unitaries but we will not make use of this generalization.

The second method of defining graph states, which we will make more use of in our proofs, utilizes the stabilizer formalism. This a much broader formalism which was developed to work with quantum error correcting codes but has found uses in many fields outside of error correction due to it's simplicity and theoretic utility. The stabilizer name comes from group theory, the group we will be working with is the Pauli group $\mathcal{P}_n$ on $n$ qubits consisting of Pauli strings and one of the four overall phases $\pm 1, \pm i$. An element of the Pauli group $K \in \mathcal{P}_n$ can act on state vectors by multiplication and a state $\ket{\psi}$ is said to be stabilized by $K$ if $K \ket{\psi} = \ket{\psi}$. We will typically work with an abelian subgroup of $S \subseteq \mathcal{P}_n$ that is defined by a set of generators $S = \langle K_1, \ldots, K_m \rangle$. The set of states that is stabilized by $S$ can be seen to be in the image of the projection operator $\Pi_S = \prod_{K \in S} \Pi_K = \prod_{K \in S} \frac{1}{2}(\identity + K)$, where $K$ is the Pauli operator (which is a reflection operator). To define our graph state we need to define a stabilizer generator $K_u$ for each vertex $u \in V$, given by
\begin{equation}
    K_u \coloneqq X_u \prod_{v \in N(u)} Z_{v}.
\end{equation}
Then $\ket{G}$ is defined to be the unique stabilizer state for the stabilizer subgroup 
\begin{equation}
    S_V \coloneqq \langle K_u \rangle_{u \in V},
\end{equation}
and can be written $\ketbra{G}{G} = \Pi_{S_V}$. We can then use a little group theory magic to write the product as a sum
\begin{align}
    \Pi_{S_G} &= \frac{1}{2^{|V|}} \prod_{u \in V} (\identity + K_u) \\
    &= \frac{1}{2^{|V|}} \sum_{b_1 = 0, \ldots, b_{|V|} = 0}^{b_1 = 1, \ldots, b_{|V|} = 1} K_1^{b_1} \ldots K_{|V|}^{b_{|V|}} \\
    &= \frac{1}{2^{|V|}} \sum_{K \in S_{V}} K,
\end{align}
where the last sum is over all stabilizers in the group.

We now have our most useful form for the density matrix associated with a graph state:
\begin{equation}
    \rho_G = \ketbra{G}{G} = \frac{1}{2^{|V|}} \sum_{K \in S_V} K,
\end{equation}
where $S_V$ consists of all possible products of single vertex stabilizers $K_u$, defined above. Before we get into computations that this formalism makes easy, we define the support of a stabilizer as the set of qubits (vertices) that the operator acts nontrivially on. For the generators this is straightforward
\begin{equation}
    \supp(K_u) = \set{u} \cup N(u).
\end{equation}
Note that stabilizers in $S_V$ are uniquely defined by the product of generators that constitute the stabilizer, which is in a one-to-one mapping with subsets of vertices. Since every vertex stabilizer has pauli $X$ factor, this means that any product of vertex stabilizers will have Pauli $X$'s on each vertex in the product, as the $Z$ factors from other generators will not be able to cancel the $X$ factors. The $Z$ factors from each vertex may or may not cancel, depending on the number of vertices that share this neighbor. For example, if we take the stabilizer $K = K_u K_v$ and $u, v$ share only one neighbor $w$ in common, then the support of $K$ will be $\set{u} \cup \set{v} \cup N(u) \cup N(v) \setminus w$. This is because $Z_w^2 = \identity$. 

This leads to defining the symmetric difference of neighborhood sets as 
\begin{equation}
    \triangle_N(U) \coloneqq \set{v \in V : | U \cap N(v) | \mod 2 = 1}.
\end{equation}
Intuitively, a vertex $v$ is in the symmetric difference of the neighbors of $U \subset V$ if and only if it is neighbors with an \emph{odd} number of vertices $u \in U$. This allows us to compute the support of a stabilizer operator as
\begin{equation}
    \supp(K_U) = \supp(K_{u_1} K_{u_2} \ldots K_{u_{|U|}}) = U \cup \triangle_N(U),
\end{equation}
as every vertex $v \in \triangle_N(U)$ will have a $Z$ operator acting on it from $K_U$ and every vertex $u \in U$ will have an $X$ operator. We can use this remarkable fact to compute traces of stabilizers, as the trace of any Pauli operator is zero and therefore the partial trace over a set $A$ of a Pauli string $K$ is zero unless $\supp(K) \subseteq A^C$. This lets us define
\begin{equation}
    S_U \coloneqq \set{K \in S_V : \supp(K) \subseteq U }.
\end{equation}
\rb{Need to add definition of minimal set of graphs as they relate very closely to support of stabilizers}


To determine if a stabilizer $K$ is in $S_U$ one needs to compute the partial trace $K \in S_U \iff \partrace{V \setminus U}{K} \neq 0$.

Now that we can compute restrictions of stabilizers to subsets of vertices we can easily compute restrictions of the graph state to subsets of vertices. This is given by the following Lemma.
\begin{lemma}
    The partial trace of the graph state is given by
    \begin{align}
        \rho_U &= \partrace{V \setminus U}{\rho_G} \\
        &= \frac{1}{2^{|V|}} \partrace{V \setminus U}{\sum_{K \in S_V} K} \\
        &= \frac{1}{2^{|V|}} \sum_{K \in S_V} \partrace{V \setminus U}{ K} \\
        &= \frac{1}{2^{|V|}} \sum_{K \in S_U} K
    \end{align}
    
\end{lemma}

\end{prop}

We begin our analysis of graph states using our method of Topological Data Analysis (TDA). The entanglement structure of a graph state is derived from the graph it represents. Topological invariants, such as the Betti number, should be capable of capturing the aforementioned entanglement structure. However, In our discussions till now this idea was not very formal such that on analyzing the betti number we immediately know what exactly the entanglement structure is. Therefore, it remained more of an intuitive conjecture. We will formalize this idea in the upcoming portions of this article.

 We will focus on lower-dimensional holes, specifically 0-dimensional and 1-dimensional holes, as higher-dimensional holes are hard to compute and analyze. To recall, the 0-dimensional Betti number corresponds to the number of connected components, while the 1-dimensional Betti number represents the number of independent cycles in the topological structure. The 1-dimensional holes in a topological structure are created by sticking in a bunch of 1-dimensional simplices which corresponds to a edge between pairs of vertices. On the other hand, the number of 0-dimensional holes decrease if an edge exists between 2 disconnected component. Both of them depend on the construction of edges within the topological structure. We construct an edge between vertices of the topological structure when the filtration parameter exceeds the correlation measure between the two vertices. Consequently, the birth time and the number of 0-dimensional and 1-dimensional holes can be derived using the two-body entropies of the input graph state.

 The specific question we trying answering was that given the birth and death time of 0 and 1 dimensional holes of an graph state can we infer the family of graphs it represents. We say a family of graph because Local Unitary equivalent graph states would share the same topological footprint. All locally unitary-equivalent graph states to the input graph $ \ket{G} $ must lie within the orbit of graph states that share the same entanglement structure or barcodes as $ \ket{G} $. Both the topological features of a quantum state and the entanglement structure of graph state depend on the marginal entropies of the system. We use these marginal entropies to infer the corresponding graph state and its topological footprint. The marginal entropies serve as a common ground that allows us to relate the system's topology to its entanglement structure. Since we are only using $1-$dimensional simplices for our analyses, we will only use $2$ body entropies measures of the system. The methodology used in this article could be duplicated for higher dimensional marginal entropies as well. Finding the family of graph states becomes increasingly difficult in higher dimensions, as the number of possible graph structures that can generate a particular entropy measure grows exponentially.

 
% The construction of topological structure depends upon the correlation function of subsets of quantum states, which in turn depends on the entropy of reduced density matrices of the input quantum systems, also known as the marginals. We investigate whether there is a specific topological signature that can help us infer the graph states responsible for these entropies.

% We will divide the discussion into 2 sections; one where we discuss the relation between entropies and graph structures and another where we discuss the relation between entropies and topology. The discussion about entropies can be thought of as a common ground to relating the graph structure and topology.

% \subsection{Entropies and graph state structure}

% We start to draw connection between entropy/correlation values of the reduced density matrices of input graph state and graph structure it produces.m. 


 
 % The 1-dimensional holes in a topological structure are created by sticking in a bunch of 1-dimensional simplices which corresponds to a edge between vertices. The 0-dimensional Betti number quantifies the number of connected components, meaning it also depends on the 1-dimensional simplices. The 0-dimensional Betti number decreases if an edge exists that connects these components. Thus, we will only need to concern ourselves with at most 2 body entropies. Consequently, we look for the structure constraints put forth by every 2 subset vertices of graph and investigate if a particular graph state can be formed using these constraints. We could perform similar analyses for subsets of vertices any size, which can viewed as approach of finding the family of graph states having the same entanglement structure. All locally unitary-equivalent graph states to the input graph $ \ket{G} $ must lie within the orbit of graph states that share the same entanglement structure or barcodes as $ \ket{G} $. 

We put forth the following proposition, which informally states that the entropy of a subset of qubits is inversely proportional to the size of the support set of that subset. This proposition works for all subsets of vertices of the graph states/qubits of the quantum state. Later, we will use this proposition extensively when formalism specific properties of agraph is necessary and suffiecnt to produce a entropy value/correlation value.

\begin{prop} \label{prop:calculating_linear_entropy_using_stablizer_support}
    The linear entropy  $S_2(A)_G $ of the reduced density operator $\rho^A_G$ associated with graph $ G = (V, E) $ and vertex set $ A \subseteq V$ can be calculated as:
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:calculating_linear_entropy_using_stablizer_support}
     S_2(A)_G = 1 - \frac{|\mathcal{S}_A|}{2^{|A|}}
    \end{equation}
    where $\mathcal{S}_A$ denotes the set of stabilizer operators for the graph 
$G$ whose support lies on vertices in set $A$.
    
\end{prop}


\begin{proof}
     Let $A \subseteq V$ be a subset of vertices of graph $G$. Let $B$ be the corresponding complement of set A, defined as $B := V\setminus A$. The reduced density operator for set A is denoted by $\rho^A_G := \Tr_B(\ket{G}\bra{G})$. 
     
    Using equation (114) in \cite{hein2006entanglement} we find that,
    \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:partialtrace_stabilizer}
        (\rho^A_G)^2 = \frac{|\mathcal{S}_A|}{2^{|A|}} \rho^A_G
    \end{equation}
    % where 
    % \begin{equation}
    % \label{eq:stabilizer_set}
    %     S_A = \{ \sigma \in S | supp(\sigma) \subseteq A \}
    % \end{equation}
    % The support of Pauli operator $\sigma =  \sigma^1_{i_1} \otimes ... \otimes \sigma^N_{i_N}$ is the set of indices $ a \in V$ for which $\sigma$ acts non-trivially on the system, (ie $i_a \neq 0$ or $\sigma_{i_a} \neq \mathbb{I}$). \\
    Using equation \eqref{eq:partialtrace_stabilizer}, linear entropy $S_2(A)_{G}$ can be calculated as
    \begin{equation}
        S_2(A)_{G} = 1 - \Tr{((\rho^A_G)^2)} = 1 -  \Tr\left( \frac{|\mathcal{S}_A|}{2^{|A|}} \rho^A_G \right) =1 - \frac{|\mathcal{S}_A|}{2^{|A|}}
    \end{equation}
\end{proof}

The proposition provides a means of inferring the graph structure from the entropy of the marginals of the input quantum state. This proposition also justifies our choice of using linear entropy for our analysis, as it offers a straightforward method for calculating the entropy of the system. Selecting one entropic measure over another does not appear to yield any additional insights during our analysis. Therefore, the choice of entropy measure may depend on the convenience of calculation or interpretation rather than its ability to provide new findings.

An interesting consequence of the propistion is that for any graph state with non-isolated vertices the linear entropy of any vertex is $0.5$. This property has its mention in \cite{hein2006entanglement} where it was stated that any pure connected graph state has maximally mixed single qubit subsystem. Another way to interpret this is that any non-isolated pure graph states are $1-$uniform quantum systems. We can prove this property using Proposition \ref{prop:calculating_linear_entropy_using_stablizer_support}. The support of any non-isolated vertex $v$, denoted $\mathcal{S}_v$, can only contain either the identity or the stabilizer operator $K_v$. Since vertex $v$ is non-isolated, the stabilizer $K_v$ applies a $Z$-operator to the neighboring vertices of $v$, which are non-empty. Therefore, the support of $K_v$ lies outside $v$, and $K_v \notin \mathcal{S}_v$. The identity element trivially belongs to $\mathcal{S}_v$. Substituting the size of $\mathcal{S}_v$ as 1 into equation \ref{eq:calculating_linear_entropy_using_stablizer_support}, we obtain the linear entropy of $v$ as $0.5$. This property of non-isolated graph states is important as we will rely on these numbers when calculating the value of correlation functions. 

We next propose conditions for the different stabilizer operators belonging to the support for a pair of vertices. The support of any pair of vertices $u, v$ is a subgroup of $\langle K_u, K_v\rangle$. By Lagrange theorem, we know  order of every subgroup must divide the the order of the larger group. It follows that the size of $\mathcal{S}_{u, v}$ can only takes values $\{ 1,2,4\}$. Our proposition maintains this property as well because if any three stabilizer operator belongs to support $\mathcal{S}_{u, v}$ then last stabilizer operator also belongs to the support. This would become more clear after viewing the local graph structure both sufficient and necessary for any stabilizer operator to belong to the support. Specifically, if three conditions are met, the fourth condition must also hold.

\begin{prop}
\label{prop:conditions_for_belonging_to_support_stabilizer}

Assume a graph $G = (V, E)$ with no isolated vertices, let $(u, v)$ be a pair of vertices in $V$. We propose

\begin{enumerate}
    \item $ K_u \in \mathcal{S}_{u,v} $ if and only if $ (N(u) \setminus \{v\}) = \emptyset $.
    \item $ K_v \in \mathcal{S}_{u,v} $ if and only if $ (N(v) \setminus \{u\}) = \emptyset $.
    \item $ K_u K_v \in \mathcal{S}_{u,v} $ if and only if $ (N(u) \setminus \{v\}) = (N(v) \setminus \{u\}) $.
\end{enumerate}
 where $K_u$ and $K_v$ are the stabilizer operator corresponding to vertex $u$ and $v$ respectively, and $\mathcal{S}_{u,v}$ is the set of stabilizer operators whose support lies in the vertex set $\{u, v\}$. 

\end{prop}
% If $(N_u = \{ v \}$ and $|N_v| > 1)$  then evidently, $K_u \otimes \mathbb{I} \in s_{u,v}$ as support of $K_u \otimes \mathbb{I}$ is a subset of $\{u, v \}$.

\begin{proof}
The backward direction of each of these conditions can be proven trivially. We make an observation that whenever the right hand side condition holds true then the stabilizer operator acts trivially on set $V \setminus \{a, b\}$. It is easy to see that this is the case for $ (N(u) \setminus \{v\}) = \emptyset $, $ (N(v) \setminus \{u\}) = \emptyset $, and $ (N(u) \setminus \{v\}) = (N(v) \setminus \{u\}) $, as in each case, the $ Z $-operation either cancels out to form the identity or is never applied to vertices outside $ \{a, b\} $.

Lets proof our claim that if $K_u \in \mathcal{S}_{u,v}$, then $ (N(u) \setminus \{v\}) = \emptyset $. This claim follows as for stabilizer operator $K_u$ can belong to $ \mathcal{S}_{u,v}$ only if $K_u$ acts trivially on set outside $\{a, b\}$. This condition is captured by the condition  $ (N(u) \setminus \{v\}) = \emptyset $ which says the neighbor set of vertex $u$ outside $\{u, v\}$ is empty. Similar argument holds true for $K_v \in \mathcal{S}_{u,v}$.

Finally, we need to prove that if $ K_u K_v \in \mathcal{S}_{u,v} $, then $ (N(u) \setminus \{v\}) = (N(v) \setminus \{u\}) $. This holds because the expressions $ (N(u) \setminus \{v\}) $ and $ (N(v) \setminus \{u\}) $ describe the sets of vertices outside $ \{u, v\} $ where the stabilizer operators $ K_u $ and $ K_v $ act non-trivially, respectively. If these sets match, the $ Z $-operations applied by each stabilizer operator cancel out, meaning that $ K_u K_v $ acts trivially on vertices outside $ \{u, v\} $. If the sets do not match, then a $ Z $-operator must act on at least one vertex outside $ \{u, v\} $, implying that $ K_u K_v $ would not belong to $ \mathcal{S}_{u,v} $. 


This can be proven more algebraically using the fact that $ K_u K_v \in \mathcal{S}_{u,v} $ if and only if $ N(u) \triangle N(v) \subseteq \{u, v\} $ or equivalently $(N(u) \setminus N(v)) \cup (N(v) \setminus N(u)) \subseteq \{u, v\}$. Assuming this condition we have that $(N(u) \setminus N(v)) \subseteq \{v\}$ and $(N(v) \setminus N(u)) \subseteq \{u\}$. The following equality holds for neighborhood set of vertex $v$, $N(u) = \{v\} \cup (N(u) \cap N(v))$ or $N(u) = N(u) \cap N(v)$. Similarly, $N(v) = \{u\} \cup (N(v) \cap N(u))$ or $N(u) = N(v) \cap N(u)$. Note that $u$ or $v$ cannot belong to $N(v) \cap N(u)$. On subtracting the respective vertices we get, $N(u) \setminus \{v\}= N(u) \cap N(v)$ and $N(v) \setminus \{u\}= N(u) \cap N(v)$. Thus we conclude that $ K_u K_v \in S_{u,v} $ if and only if $ (N(u) \setminus \{v\}) = (N(v) \setminus \{u\}) $.

\end{proof}
We build our topological structure based on correlation measures. Consequently, we need to find graph structural conditions for different values of correlation function. These values of correlation measures depend on size of the stabilizer state, so we would derive these conditions using the previous proposition. There are multiple ways a particular size of the support set could be achieved. Consequently, we get often get a umbrella of conditions that could produce a particular correlation function value. For example, since there 3 ways to derive sets of order 2 from sets of order 3, we get 3 possible conditions that could lead to support of stabilizer being of size $2$.

\begin{prop} \label{prop:correlation_function_relation_with_graph_structure}
Given a graph $ G = (V, E) $ with no isolated vertices, we propose that the 2-deformed correlation function for any vertex pair $ (u, v) $, denoted $ C_2(u, v) $, satisfies the following conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $C_2(u, v) = 1 \iff (N(u) \setminus \{v\} = N(v) \setminus \{u\} = \emptyset)$
    \item
    $C_2(u, v) = 0.5 \iff 
\begin{aligned}(N(u) \setminus \{v\} = N(v) \setminus \{u\} \neq \emptyset) \text{ or } \\
(N(u) \setminus \{v\} = \emptyset \text{ and } N(v) \setminus \{u\} \neq \emptyset) 
\text{ or } \\
(N(v) \setminus \{u\} = \emptyset \text{ and } N(u) \setminus \{v\} \neq \emptyset)
\end{aligned}$

% \begin{align}
%     lS
% \end{align}

% $C_2(u, v) = 0.5  \iff (N(u) \setminus \{v\} = N(v) \setminus \{u\} \neq \emptyset) \text{ or } (N(u) \setminus \{v\} = \emptyset \text{ and } N(v) \setminus \{u\} \neq \emptyset) \text{ or }  (N(v) \setminus \{u\} = \emptyset \text{ and } N(u) \setminus \{v\} \neq \emptyset)$
    \item $ C_2(u, v) = 0.25 \iff (N(u) \setminus \{v\}) \neq (N(v) \setminus \{u\}) \text{ and } (N(u) \setminus \{v\}), (N(v) \setminus \{u\}) \neq \emptyset $

\end{enumerate}

where $ N(u) $ and $ N(v) $ represent the neighborhoods of vertices $ u $ and $ v $, respectively.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    
Assume a pair of vertices $u, v \in V$. As discussed earlier, we know that the the linear entropy of vertices $u$ and $v$ is $0.5$. Plugging in these values in equation for 2-deformed correlation function, 

\begin{align}
    C_2(u, v) &= S_2(u) + S_2(v) - S_2(u, v) \\
    &=0.5 * 2 - \left(1 - \frac{|\mathcal{S}_{u,v}|}{2^{|\{u,v\}|}}\right) \\
\label{eq:correlation_function_relation_to_number_of_stabilizer_operator}
    &= \frac{|\mathcal{S}_{u,v}|}{4} 
\end{align}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Condition 1}: The above equation that gives us the condition $ C_2(u, v) = 1 \iff |\mathcal{S}_{u,v}| = 4 $. This condition is satisfied if and only if $ \mathcal{S}_{u,v} = \{\identity, K_u, K_v, K_uK_v\} $ as $\mathcal{S}_{u,v} \subseteq \langle K_u, K_v \rangle$. This is only possible if all the conditions presented in proposition \ref{prop:conditions_for_belonging_to_support_stabilizer} is satisfied. Consequently, we have that $ N(u) \setminus \{v\} = \emptyset $ and $ N(v) \setminus \{u\} = \emptyset $, leading us to the conclusion

    \begin{equation}
    C_2(u, v) = 1 \iff (N(u) \setminus \{v\} = N(v) \setminus \{u\} = \emptyset).
    \end{equation}
    
    \item \textbf{Condition 2}: From equation \ref{eq:correlation_function_relation_to_number_of_stabilizer_operator} we get the equality that  $ C_2(u, v) = 0.5 \iff |\mathcal{S}_{u,v}| = 2 $. Since the identity operator is trivially always part of $\mathcal{S}_{u,v}$. The condition $|\mathcal{S}_{u,v}| = 2 $ is true if and only if only one of $K_u$ or $K_v$ or $K_{u, v}$ is part of $\mathcal{S}_{u,v}$. This enforces the constraint that the conditions presented in proposition \ref{prop:conditions_for_belonging_to_support_stabilizer} are exclusive. In other words, if one of the conditions are true then the rest of the conditions becomes false. 
    Lets look at the case when $K_u \in \mathcal{S}_{u,v}$ while $K_v \not \in \mathcal{S}_{u, v} \text{ and } K_{u, v} \not \in \mathcal{S}_{u, v}$. Using \ref{prop:conditions_for_belonging_to_support_stabilizer}, we get the condition that $(N(u) \setminus \{v\}) = \emptyset $ and $(N(v) \setminus \{u\}) \neq \emptyset $. Similar results is obtained when considering $K_v \in \mathcal{S}_{u,v}$ while $K_u \not \in \mathcal{S}_{u, v} \text{ and } K_{u, v} \not \in \mathcal{S}_{u, v}$. 
    Assume $K_uK_v \in \mathcal{S}_{u,v}$ and $K_u \not \in S_{u, v} \text{ and } K_v \not \in \mathcal{S}_{u, v}$. Using \ref{prop:conditions_for_belonging_to_support_stabilizer}, we get the conditions that $ (N(u) \setminus \{v\}) = (N(v) \setminus \{u\}) $ and $(N(u) \setminus \{v\}) \neq \emptyset$ and $(N(v) \setminus \{u\}) \neq \emptyset$. Summarizing the results we get that 
    
    $$C_2(u, v) = 0.5 \iff 
\begin{aligned}(N(u) \setminus \{v\} = N(v) \setminus \{u\} \neq \emptyset) \text{ or } \\
(N(u) \setminus \{v\} = \emptyset \text{ and } N(v) \setminus \{u\} \neq \emptyset) 
\text{ or } \\
(N(v) \setminus \{u\} = \emptyset \text{ and } N(u) \setminus \{v\} \neq \emptyset)
\end{aligned}$$

    
    \item \textbf{Condition 3}: From equation \ref{eq:correlation_function_relation_to_number_of_stabilizer_operator}, we can form condition that $C_2(u, v) = 0.25 \iff |\mathcal{S}_{u,v}| = 1$. Using the result presented in \cite{guhne2009entanglement}, which states that all stabilizer operators of vertex set $\{u, v\}$ (except for the identity operator) have support on vertex set outside $\{u, v\}$  if and only if $ (N(u) \setminus \{v\}) \neq (N(v) \setminus \{u\}) $ and both $ (N(u) \setminus \{v\}) $ and $ (N(v) \setminus \{u\}) $ are non-empty. Thus we arrive at the conclusion that 
    \begin{equation}
        C_2(u, v) = 0.25 \iff (N(u) \setminus \{v\}) \neq (N(v) \setminus \{u\}) \text{ and } (N(u) \setminus \{v\}), (N(v) \setminus \{u\}) \neq \emptyset
    \end{equation} 
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}

 These are all the propositions we would need to for proving our main results. We propose that, by analyzing the entropic measures of every two-subset, we can detect graph states that are locally unitary (LU) equivalent to the GHZ state. This is a unique property of the GHZ state, as the entanglement across any bipartition remains constant and equal to 1 (when using von Neumann entropy). Due to the uniform and constant entanglement structure, the conditions imposed by Proposition \ref{prop:correlation_function_relation_with_graph_structure} forces the graph to adopt either a star or complete graph structure. Before presenting the theorem we will prove a lemma that would be useful while proving the main theorem.
 
 \begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:complete_graph_iff_neighbor_set_condition}
   For a graph G with no isolated vertices, Graph $G = (V, E)$ is a complete graph if and only if $N(u) \setminus \{v\} = N(v)\setminus \{u\} \neq \emptyset$ for every $u,v \in V$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof} 
Consider graph $G = (V, E)$ to be a complete graph, we will show that $N(u) \setminus \{v\} = N(v)\setminus \{u\}$ for every $u,v \in V$. Let $u, v$ be vertices in $G$, $u, v \in V$. By definition of complete graph, every vertex pair in graph $G$ is connected by an unique edge. The neighborhood of $u$ and $v$ is $N(u) = V \setminus \{u\}$ and $N(v) = V \setminus \{v\}$ respectively. Computing $N(u) \setminus \{v\}$ and $N(v) \setminus \{u\}$ yields, 
\begin{equation}
N_u \setminus \{v\} = N_v \setminus \{u\} = V \setminus \{u, v\}    
\end{equation}
Hence, if the graph G is a complete graph, then $N(u) \setminus \{v\} = N(v)\setminus \{u \} \neq \emptyset$ for every $u,v \in V$.

Consider a graph $ G = (V, E) $ with no isolated vertex. Assume that $ N(u) \setminus \{v\} = N(v) \setminus \{u\} \neq \emptyset $ for any distinct vertex pair $ u, v \in V $. To reach a contradiction, assume that $G$ is not complete. Let $u, v \in V$ such that they are not adjacent and by assumption we know $N(u) \setminus \{v\} = N(v)\setminus \{u\} \neq \emptyset$. This implies that there exists at least one vertex $w$ adjacent to both $u$ and $v$. We know that $N(u) \setminus \{w\} = N(w)\setminus \{u\} \neq \emptyset$, by assumption of the proposition. Since vertex $v$ is adjacent to vertex $w$ we have that $v \in  N(w)\setminus \{u\}$. This violates the condition that $N(u) \setminus \{w\} = N(w)\setminus \{u\} \neq \emptyset$ because vertex $u, v$ are non-adjacent. We get a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:graph_strcuture_iff_2-entropy}
Let $\rho = \ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}$ be a pure graph state with isolated vertices corresponding to graph $G = (V, E)$ in the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H_A} = (\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes n}$. We propose that $\rho$ is locally unitary equivalent to an $n$-qubit GHZ state if and only if the 2-deformed correlation measure of every 2-qubit subsystem of $\rho$ is 0.5, i.e., $C_2(J) = 0.5$ for all $J \subseteq A$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    The forward direction of the proof is straightforward. Assume a quantum state $\rho$ such that it is $LU$-equivalent to the GHZ state. Notice that $\rho$ will share the marginal entropies as the GHZ state as $LU$ keeps the entropies invariant. 
The $ n $-qubit GHZ state is expressed as


\begin{equation}
    \ket{GHZ_n} = \frac{\ket{0}^{\otimes n} + \ket{1}^{\otimes n}}{\sqrt{2}}.
\end{equation}



When performing the partial trace over any subsystem of a GHZ state, the resulting reduced density matrix has a spectrum of $0.5$ with multiplicity $2$ and the remaining eigenvalues are 0. We can compute the linear entropy of any reduced density matrix $\rho_A$ as 
\begin{align}
    S_2(A) &= 1 - \trace{\rho_A^2} \\
    &= 1 - \sum_{i} \lambda(i)^2 \\
    &= 1 - 2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2} \right)^2 = 1/2.
\end{align}
This holds for all proper subsets $ A \subset S $. The linear entropy of any 1 or 2 qubit subsystem is $ 0.5 $. Specifically, for any qubit pair $ u, v $, we have $ S_2(u) = S_2(v) = S_2(u, v) = 0.5 $. The 2-deformed correlation for any qubit subsystem is then computed as 
\begin{equation}
C_2(u, v) = S_2(u) + S_2(v) - S_2(u, v) = 2 \cdot 0.5 - 0.5 = 0.5.
\end{equation}

Lets prove the backward direction of the theorem. Lets assume that the 2-deformed correlation function for any pair of vertices $ (u, v) $ in $V$ is $ C_2(u, v) = 0.5 $. We will prove that the corresponding graph is a star or a complete graph.

There are 2 cases we consider here 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Case 1 :} $\exists u \in V$ such that $deg(u) = 1$ \\
    Assume vertex $ u $ has degree 1, such that it adjacent to $ w \in V $. For any vertex $v \in V\setminus\{u,w\}$ we assume that $C_2(u, v) = 0.5$. Using proposition \ref{prop:correlation_function_relation_with_graph_structure} and the fact that $N(u) \setminus \{v\} =\{w\} \neq \emptyset$ we can conclude that either $N(v) \setminus\{u\} = \emptyset$ or $N(v) \setminus\{u\} = \{w\}$. We see that condition that $N(v) \setminus\{u\} = \emptyset$ is not possible. The condition implies that either the neighbor set of vertex $v$ is empty or a leaf vertex adjacent to $u$. Since we assume our graph to have non-isolated vertices the neighbor set cannot be empty. On the other hand, vertex $v$ cannot be adjacent to $u$ as $u$ has degree 1 and is only adjacent to vertex $w$. We can arrive at the conclusion that for any vertex $v \in V\setminus\{u,w\}$, $N(v) = \{w\} $. This tells us that graph G is a star graph.
     \item \textbf{Case 2 :} $\forall u \in V$ such that $deg(u) > 1$ \\
In this case, we can apply Proposition \ref{prop:correlation_function_relation_with_graph_structure} to obtain the condition $ N(u) = N(v) \neq \emptyset $ for all $ u, v \in V $. By using Lemma \ref{lemma:complete_graph_iff_neighbor_set_condition}, we conclude that $ G $ must be a complete graph.
\end{itemize}
The graph state corresponds to the star or complete graph which is LU equivalent to the GHZ state. Thus we conclude our proof.
\end{proof}

We can rewrite the above proposition with entropy measures instead of correlation measure. We choose to make this proposition with respect to correlation measure because it would be easier to relate to topological features which are constructed using these measures. Since we are assuming the Graph G to be connected, the linear entropy of any single qubit subsystem is $0.5$. We get that the correlation measure for any pair of vertices $u, v$, $C(u, v) = 0.5 \iff S(u, v) = 0.5$. 

\begin{corollary}
    If a stabilizer state $\ket{\psi}$ has 2-deformed correlation measure or linear entropy of every pair of qubits equal to $0.5$. then the state is LU equivalent to the GHZ state.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
    It is well known that every stabilizer state is LU equivalent to some graph state \cite{Walter_multipartite_entanglement}. Let \(\ket{\psi}\) be a state that is locally unitary (LU) equivalent to the graph state \(\ket{G}\), representing a connected graph \(G\). Specifically, \(\ket{\psi} = U_{\psi} \ket{G}\), where \(U_{\psi}\) is a local unitary operation. A local unitary operation \(U\) is more formally defined as \(U = \otimes_{i=1}^{n} U_i\), where \(U_i\) is a unitary operator acting on the \(i\)-th qubit, and \(n\) is the number of qubits. The graph state \(\ket{G}\) shares the same entanglement structure as \(\ket{\psi}\). Given our assumptions regarding the entropy/correlation function values, along with Theorem \(\ref{thm:graph_strcuture_iff_2-entropy}\), we can assert that \(\ket{G} = U_G \ket{GHZ}\), where \(U_G\) is a local unitary operation. Consequently, we conclude that \(\ket{\psi} = U_{\psi} U_G \ket{GHZ}\), which shows that \(\ket{\psi}\) is LU equivalent to the GHZ state.
\end{proof}

 We observe that the structure of the graph is responsible for the marginal entropies of a state. Conversely, given a marginal entropy of a graph state, there will be certain structural features of the graph state that produces such an entropic value. Every subset of vertices thus enforces a certain restriction of what the original graph can look like. If we are given the entropies of all the marginals, then constructing the original graph states becomes a constraint satisfying problem. A set of marginal entropies may be consistent with a family of graph states because there are multiple ways a particular entropic value can be achieved by choosing different stabilizer operators to include in the support set. If we identify the family of graph states that corresponds to a given set of marginal entropies, we can conclude that any LU-equivalent graph will always belong to this family. The problem of solving for LU-equivalent graphs has been a topic of recent study.

 % Now we start our discussion about topology and show that such states generate a unique topological footprint. Specifically, we focus on the low-dimensional Betti numbers, as they provide insights into the entanglement structure of the 2-qubit marginals. However, these Betti numbers lack direct interpretation, as we do not yet fully understand which entanglement properties of the quantum state give rise to these Betti numbers, or what causes them to persist longer than others. By relating the topological footprint to the GHZ state, we present an application of the Betti numbers for identifying GHZ states.

 Lets look at how our topological structure denoted by $\mathcal{X} $ behaves for different values of the correlation function. this will help us build the intuition that leads to the next theorem, where we present the specific birth and death times of the Betti numbers for LU-equivalent GHZ states, explaining why this structure is unique for LU-equivalent GHZ states. The topological structure begins with $n$ disconnected vertices. At $\epsilon = 0$, we will always have $n$ disconnected components and consequently $n$ $0-$dimensional holes. The number of $0-$dimensional holes decrease as more edges are introduced. When there is only one connected component, we are left with a single 0-dimensional hole, which persists indefinitely until we reach $ \epsilon_{\text{max}} $, at which point the analysis stops. In our case, the correlation function outputs 0.5 for any 2-subset of vertices in the topological structure $ \mathcal{X} $. We can be certain that no simplex is formed for $ \epsilon < 0.5 $, as a 1-dimensional simplex cannot form within this range, and higher-dimensional simplices do not form before 1-dimensional simplices due to the downward closure property (see Ref. \ref{eq:downward_closure_total_correlation}). Consequently, the topological structure has $n$ $0-$dimensional holes. Conversely, if the TDA output shows $ n $ 0-dimensional simplices within the range $[0, 0.5)$, we can conclude that any pair of vertices has a correlation of at least 0.5. If the correlation function takes a value within this range, an edge is formed, leading to a reduction in the number of 0-dimensional holes.


Now, let's examine the 1-dimensional holes. These holes correspond to the number of independent cycles in the topological structure $ \mathcal{X} $. It is important to emphasize the term "independent" because if a cycle can be expressed as a linear combination of other cycles, it is not counted in the Betti number. Given our assumption that the graph state corresponds to a connected graph, the earliest filtration parameter at which a 2-simplex can form is $ 1 $ (see \ref{prop:calculating_linear_entropy_using_stablizer_support}). We can be confident that, in this case, there will be no higher-dimensional simplices that reduce the number of 1-dimensional holes. Therefore, the problem of finding 1-dimensional holes in the topological structure $ \mathcal{X} $ reduces to identifying the number of independent cycles in the graph. In the following theorem, we will present an explicit formula for computing this value.

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:betti_number_iff_2-entropy}
There are $ n $ 0-dimensional holes for $ 0 \leq \epsilon < 0.5 $. At $ \epsilon = 0.5 $, one 0-dimensional hole and $ \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} $ 1-dimensional holes form if and only if the graph state $\rho$ corresponding to graph $G =(V, E)$ has 2-deformed correlation measure of every 2-qubit subsystem of $\rho$ is 0.5, i.e., $C_2(J) = 0.5$ for all $J \subseteq A$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Lets prove the forward direction first. Assume that for $ 0 \leq \epsilon < 0.5 $, there are $ n $ 0-dimensional holes, and at $ \epsilon = 0.5 $, there is one 0-dimensional hole and $ \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} $ 1-dimensional holes.

Based on the lifespan of $0-$dimensional holes, we can infer that there exists no pair of vertices with correlation measure less than $0.5$. At $\epsilon = 0.5$. there is exactly 1 connected component ($ c = 1 $) corresponding to the single 0-dimensional hole. At this value of the filtration parameter, the space consists of $ n $ vertices, 1 connected component, and $ \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} $ 1-dimensional holes, which correspond to the dimension of the cycle basis.

The dimension of the cycle basis is given in \cite{hage1996island} and is computed using the number of edges, vertices, and connected components
\begin{equation}
\text{Cycle basis dimension} = m - n + c,
\end{equation}
where $ m $ is the number of edges, $ n $ is the number of vertices, and $ c = 1 $ is the number of connected components. Substituting the values:
\begin{equation}
\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} = m - n + 1
\end{equation}
Solving for $ m $, we find:
\begin{equation}
m = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
\end{equation}
Therefore, the topological structure \( \mathcal{X} \) is a complete graph at \( \epsilon = 0.5 \). As a result, the correlation measure between every pair of vertices is exactly 0.5, since for any pair of vertices \( u, v \), the condition \( C(u, v) \leq 0.5 \) is satisfied, and we also know that \( C_2(u, v) \geq 0.5 \), as no edges are within range $[0, 0.5)$

Lets prove the backward direction of the statement. Assume that for every pair of vertices the $C_2(u, v) = 0.5$. Tracking the behavious of the topological structure we see that there will be $n$ disconnected vertices in $\mathcal{X}$ and at $\epsilon=0.5$ the entire space forms a complete graph. This explain the behavior of the $0-$dimensional holes.

At $\epsilon = 0.5$ we start to observe the birth of $1-$dimensional holes. The number of 1-dimensional holes corresponds to the dimension of the cycle basis. For a complete graph with $ n $ vertices, the number of edges is $ \frac{n(n-1)}{2} $, and there is 1 connected component. 

% The dimension of the cycle basis is given by the formula $ m - n + c $, where $ m $ is the number of edges, $ n $ is the number of vertices, and $ c $ is the number of connected components. 

Substituting the values in the equation for the dimension of the cycle basis, we get:

\begin{equation}
\frac{n(n-1)}{2} - n + 1 = \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}
\end{equation}


Thus, at $ \epsilon = 0.5 $, there is a single 0-dimensional hole and $ \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} $ 1-dimensional holes. Hence, the proposition follows in the backward direction.
\end{proof}

% \begin{corollary}
% Let $\rho = \ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}$ be a pure multipartite quantum state in Hilbert space $(\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes n}$. We propose that $\rho$ is a local unitary equivalent $n$ qubit GHZ state if and only if the linear entropy of every 2 qubit subsystem of $\rho$ is 0.5.
% \end{corollary}

\begin{theorem}
    Let $\rho = \ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}$ be a pure multipartite graph quantum state in Hilbert space $(\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes n}$. The quantum system $\rho$ generates $n$ 0-dimensional holes for $0 \leq \epsilon < 0.5$ and at $\epsilon = 0.5$, one 0-dimensional holes and $\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}$ 1-dimensional hole if and only if the graph associated with $\rho$ is a star or complete graph.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
   The proof follows directly from applying Theorem \ref{thm:betti_number_iff_2-entropy} and Theorem \ref{thm:graph_strcuture_iff_2-entropy}. Both the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of the theorem describe a scenario where the correlation function takes the value 0.5 for every pair of qubits in the graph state. Therefore, their equivalence follows.
